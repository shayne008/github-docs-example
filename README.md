# Let's Write Good Documenation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks.

Codeblocks in markdown makes it *easier* for others to **copy, paste and share** code.
Cloud Engineers uses codeblocks whenever possible.

It allows others to replicate and reseacrh issues.

- In order to create codeblocks uses backticks ``` and not quotations (')


### Example Codeblock with Go
```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

- When you can apply syntax highlighting to your codeblocks.


```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

- Make note of backtick key button is located, on the tidle key.
- Above tab key.

Good Cloud Engineers use codeblocks for both Code and Errors that appear in the console.


```bash
panic: runtime error: integer divide by zero
```

> Here is an example of a codeblock for an error that appears in bash.

## Step -3 Use GitHub Flavored Task Lists

GitHub extends Markdown to include check off lists. [<sup>[1]</sup>](#references)

- [x] Finish Step 1
- [] Finish Step 2
- [x] Finish Step 3
- [x] Finish Step 4
- [x] Finish Step 5

  
# Step 4 - Use Emojis

GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) supports emoji shortcodes.
Here are some examples:

| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud | `:cloud:` | :cloud: |
| Face in Clouds | `face_in_clouds:` | üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è: |

# Step 5 - How To Create A Table

```md
| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud | `:cloud:` | :cloud: |
| Face in Clouds | `face_in_clouds:` | üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è: |
